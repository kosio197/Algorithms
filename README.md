**Course description:**<br />
Курсът по алгоритми развива умения за алгоритмично мислене и решаване на алгоритмични проблеми. Разглеждат се основните
класове алгоритми, използвани в практиката: рекурсия и рекурсивни алгоритми, търсене с връщане назад (backtracking), комбинаторни алгоритми, алгоритми за сортиране и търсене, динамично оптимиране, графи и алгоритми върху графи, разпределени изчисления с 
map-reduce.
